## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms are essential foundations for solving complex problems efficiently in computer science. Understanding these concepts allows us to design efficient algorithms, optimize code, and build scalable software applications.

This repository aims to provide a collection of commonly used Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in different programming languages. Each implementation includes a detailed explanation of the concept, the code, and examples of usage.

## Data Structures

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree
- Heap
- Hash Table
- Graph
- Trie
- AVL Tree
- Red-Black Tree

## Algorithms

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Graph Algorithms (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm)
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion
- Backtracking
- Divide and Conquer
- Greedy Algorithms

Each implementation is organized in dedicated directories, containing the source code files and accompanying documentation.
